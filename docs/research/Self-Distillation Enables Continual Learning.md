## ABSTRACT

```
Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without de-
grading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models.
While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit re-
ward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the pri-
mary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-
policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that en-
ables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learn-
ing by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy
training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill
learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achiev-
ing higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In se-
quential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills
over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practi-
cal path to continual learning from demonstrations. Code and Datasets are available at

Figure 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly
used to learn from expert demonstration datasets,
but its off-policy nature leads to catastrophic for-
getting of general capabilities. We introduce Self-
Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), which turns expert
demonstrations into on-policy learning signals by us-
ing a demonstration-conditioned version of the model
as its own teacher. In this way, SDFT enables true con-
tinual learning with the model improving on new tasks
as they arise without regressing existing capabilities.

Foundation models have achieved remarkable suc-
cess in recent years, powering AI applications
across language, vision, robotics, and beyond. How-
ever, despite their impressive capabilities, today’s
AI systems remain static after deployment. While
they can adapt their behavior at inference time
through mechanisms such as retrieval or prompting,
they do not update their parameters to acquire new
skills, internalize new knowledge, or improve from
experience. To enable the next generation of foun-
dation models, we must solve the problem of con-
tinual learning: enabling AI systems to keep learn-
ing and improving over time, similar to how humans
accumulate knowledge and refine skills throughout
their lives (Hassabis et al., 2017; De Lange et al.,
2021).

A growing body of recent work has highlighted
the importance of on-policy learning for contin-
ual learning. When models learn from data gener-
ated by their current policy, they exhibit substan-
tially reduced catastrophic forgetting compared to
off-policy alternatives (Shenfeld et al., 2025; Chen
et al., 2025). To date, most successful on-policy ap-
proaches have been developed in the context of re-
inforcement learning (RL), where feedback is pro-
vided through an explicit reward function. However, in many real-world settings such rewards are unavail-
able or difficult to specify. Instead, learning typically proceeds from datasets of expert demonstrations. The
dominant paradigm in this regime is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which trains the model to imitate expert

Figure 2: (Left) SDFT leverages a model’s in-context learning ability to generate on-policy training signals.
For each query x, the model acts in two roles. A student that is conditioned only on the query P = π(·|x) and
the teacher, which is the same model conditioned on an expert demonstration c, producing a demonstration-
aware distribution Q = π(·|x,c). Training minimizes the reverse KL divergence between the student and
teacher, yielding on-policy updates. (Right) Conditioning the model on the expert demonstrations creates a
teacher with an output distribution that is substantially closer to the base model, while maintaining the same
new-task accuracy.

actions under a fixed, offline data distribution. While simple and scalable, SFT is inherently off-policy, and
prior work has shown that sequential SFT can lead to poor generalization and severe catastrophic forgetting
when models are adapted to new tasks or domains (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Li & Hoiem, 2017). This tension
raises a fundamental challenge for continual learning: how can we obtain the benefits of on-policy learning
when only demonstrations are available?

The challenges of off-policy learning can, in principle, be overcome by first learning a reward function from
demonstrations (i.e., Inverse Reinforcement Learning or IRL), and then performing on-policy RL (Ng et al.,
2000; Abbeel & Ng, 2004). While IRL is conceptually elegant, effectively recovering rewards typically
requires strong priors over the reward structure, which has limited its practical adoption to settings where
such assumptions are justified, such as RLHF (Peng et al., 2018; Stiennon et al., 2020).

Rather than inferring an explicit reward function, we propose Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an on-
policy distillation (Ross et al., 2011; Agarwal et al., 2024) framework for learning directly from demon-
strations. SDFT relies on the observation that large pretrained models exhibit strong in-context learning—the
ability to adapt their behavior when conditioned on examples, without parameter updates (Brown et al., 2020).
We exploit this property by using the same model in two roles: a teacher, conditioned on both the task input
and an expert demonstration, and a student, conditioned only on the task input. Training distills the teacher’s
predictions into the student on trajectories generated by the student itself, yielding on-policy updates that
incorporate information from demonstrations without explicit reward inference or offline imitation.

We evaluate SDFT in two continual learning settings: skill learning, where demonstrations are used to im-
prove performance on a task, and knowledge acquisition, where new information must be incorporated into
the model. Across both settings, SDFT provides stable on-policy updates that enable learning while substan-
tially reducing catastrophic forgetting compared to supervised learning. Consistent with prior work on on-
policy learning (Ross et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2025), SDFT also improves generalization both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution, making it beneficial even in settings where retaining prior capabilities is not the pri-
mary objective. In a sequential learning experiment involving three distinct skills, SDFT enables a single
model to acquire each skill in turn while preserving performance on previously learned skills as well as on
unrelated, pre-existing capabilities — demonstrating that continual learning from demonstrations is possible.

## 2 RELATED WORK

Off-policy versus On-policy Learning. A long line of work highlights the advantages of on-policy learn-
ing, i.e., training on trajectories induced by the model itself, over off-policy learning. The seminal result of
Ross et al. (2011) shows that off-policy imitation learning suffers from compounding errors at inference time,
as the learned policy drifts away from the states covered in the demonstrations, errors accumulate rapidly, a
failure mode that on-policy algorithms avoid by continually training under their own state distribution. More


recent empirical studies reinforce this distinction. Models fine-tuned with on-policy RL have been shown to
generalize better beyond the training distribution (Agarwal et al., 2024; Han et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025; Li
et al., 2025) and transfer more effectively to related tasks (Huan et al., 2025) than models trained purely off-
policy. In continual learning settings, on-policy updates also reduce catastrophic forgetting when adapting to
new tasks (Shenfeld et al., 2025; Lai et al., 2025). These findings collectively motivate our goal - to enable
on-policy learning from demonstrations, thereby retaining the benefits of on-policy RL while avoiding the
need for explicit reward engineering.

Inverse Reinforcement Learning. IRL (Ng et al., 2000) provides a classical solution to the problem faced
in many RL settings: the agent must learn a policy when no explicit reward function is available, only
demonstrations. Rather than cloning the expert’s actions, IRL seeks to infer the underlying reward for which
those demonstrations would be optimal. This perspective avoids the issues of off-policy imitation learning,
since the inferred reward can support on-policy updates (Xu et al., 2020). While this idea has deep theoretical
appeal, traditional IRL methods are known not to scale well (Lazzati et al., 2024; Arora & Doshi, 2021).

A common thread across all successful IRL formulations is that they rely on strong structural assumptions to
make the reward identifiable. Maximum-entropy IRL assumes that experts follow a soft-optimal Boltzmann
policy (Ziebart et al., 2008; Wulfmeier et al., 2015); adversarial IRL methods (Ho & Ermon, 2016) assume
that expert and learner trajectories can be distinguished by a classifier; and preference-based IRL methods,
such as RLHF (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), assume access to pairs of positive–negative demon-
strations. These priors are essential—without them, IRL is either ill-posed or too expensive to be practical. In
our approach, rather than imposing an explicit learning reward function, we leverage the model’s in-context
learning to extract an on-policy learning signal.

Context Distillation. Our method also relates to the growing line of work on context distillation, in which a
model conditioned on additional information acts as a teacher for a version of itself without that information
(Bai et al., 2022; Snell et al., 2022). Prior approaches typically rely on offline distillation from static contexts,
such as few-shot examples or behavioral guidelines, and supervise the student on trajectories drawn from the
teacher’s distribution. Our algorithm differs in two important ways. First, the distillation is on-policy: the
student is trained under its own induced trajectory distribution, allowing the teacher to correct errors as they
arise (Ross et al., 2011; Agarwal et al., 2024). Second, the context provided to the teacher is not a fixed
prompt prefix but a specific demonstration chosen for each query. This dynamic, instance-wise conditioning
enables the teacher to express fine-grained task intent, rather than a single global behavioral prior. Together,
these differences allow context distillation to function not merely as a form of prompt compression but as an
IRL-like mechanism that extracts and transfers the underlying reasoning induced by demonstrations.

## 3 SELF-DISTILLATION FINE-TUNING

Our approach builds on the framework of student-teacher distillation, where a student model is trained to
match the behavior of a teacher model by minimizing the divergence between their output distributions.
Traditionally, distillation uses separate models, typically a larger, more capable teacher and a smaller student
(Hinton et al., 2015). Our key innovation is that we can use the same model as both teacher and student by
exploiting its in-context learning abilities. Specifically, given a foundation model with policy π, we construct
the teacher by conditioning it on expert demonstrations: π(·|x,c), where x is the task prompt and c is a
demonstration. The student is simply the base model without this conditioning πθ(·|x).

To construct the teacher for a given prompt x, we condition the model on both the prompt and a demonstration
using the following simple prompt:

<Question>
This is an example for a response to the question:
<Demonstration>
Now answer with a response of your own, including the thinking process:

We find that this prompt is sufficient to prevent the policy from outputting c verbatim and instead elicits a
response that reflects the model’s understanding of the intent behind the demonstration, leveraging its in-
context learning capabilities. See subsection 3.2 for further analysis of the conditioned policy’s outputs.

As mentioned before, we hypothesize that on-policy learning is necessary for continual learning; therefore,
we train the student using on-policy distillation from the teacher. For every prompt x, our algorithm, SDFT,


samples responses from the student policy y ∼ πθ(·|x) and minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between the student and the teacher distributions:

```
L(θ) = DKL(πθ(·|x)∥ π(·|x,c)) =Ey∼πθ(y|x)
```

### 

Leveraging the autoregressive nature of the model, we decompose this objective into a token-level loss (see
Tang & Munos (2025) for a derivation) and take the gradient with respect to the student parameters θ while
treating the teacher distribution as fixed. This results in the following gradient estimator:

∇θL(θ) =Ey∼πθ

whereV is the token vocabulary. A critical component of SDFT is the parameterization of the teacher model
used to compute the likelihood ratios. While the teacher is always conditioned on the demonstrations c, its
weights can be defined in multiple ways. Subsection 4.6 includes an ablation regarding this design choice,
but unless mentioned otherwise, we use an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student parameters for
the teacher. A full detailed description of our algorithm can be found in Algorithm 1 in the appendix.

### 3.1 SELF-DISTILLATION AS INVERSE RL

Although we present our algorithm from a student-teacher distillation perspective, it can also be interpreted
in the IRL framework, where it maximizes an implicit reward function. In the following section, we for-
mally show that our self-distillation objective is mathematically equivalent to maximizing an implicit reward
function defined by the expert demonstrations and the model’s in-context learning capabilities.

We begin with the standard formulation of trust-region-regularized reinforcement learning Schulman et al.
(2015), where the policy update in step k + 1 is constrained to stay close to the current policy πk:

```
πk+1= max
π
```
```
Ey∼π[r(y,x)]− βDKL(π(·|x)∥πk(·|x)) (3)
```
For this objective, the optimal policy πk∗+1takes the known closed-form expression of a tilted distribution
(Korbak et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023):

```
π∗k+1(y|x)∝ πk(y|x) exp(
```
### 1

```
β
```
```
r(y,x))
```
Rearranging this equation allows us to express the underlying reward as a function of the divergence between
the optimal and previous policies:

```
r(y,x) = β
```
### 

```
logπ∗k+1(y|x)− logπk(y|x)
```
### 

### + C

In a standard IRL setting, πk∗+1is unknown. However, our key idea is that the model’s own in-context learning
capabilities provide a robust approximation of this optimal policy. We introduce our In-Context Assumption

- given a demonstration c, the model conditioned on c approximates the optimal next policy.

```
π∗k+1(y|x)≈ π(y|x,c) (4)
```
This substitution posits that the behavioral shift induced by observing a demonstration reflects the expert’s
true intent. Substituting this into Eq. (6), we derive an intrinsic reward function:

```
r(y,x,c) = logπ(y|x,c)− logπk(y|x) (5)
```
We drop β and C since linear transformations of reward do not affect the optimal policy (Sutton et al.,
1998). While this defines a trajectory-level reward, our model has an autoregressive structure. Therefore, we
decompose the reward into token-level rewards rtvia token-level probabilities. We define the instantaneous
reward as the immediate log-probability change:

```
rt(yt|y<t,x,c) = log
```
```
π(yt|y<t,x,c)
πk(yt|y<t,x)
```
### ,

and indeed for all y, we have

### P

trt(yt|y<t,x,c) = r(y,x,c). Finally, we demonstrate that optimizing the
policy with respect to this reward is equivalent to the reverse-KL distillation used in our method. The policy
gradient under the current policy πkis:

```
∇θJ(πk) =Ey∼πk[r(y,x,c)∇θlogπk(y|x)]

Figure 3: In a challenging continual learning experiment, where one model is trained sequentially on three
different tasks, SDFT is able to learn each one while retaining performance on the others. In contrast, SFT
performance on each task drops once it starts learning the next one. Performance is linearly normalized such
that 0 corresponds to the base model accuracy on each one of the tasks, and 1 to the maximum accuracy
obtained across both algorithms.

Substituting our derived reward from Equation 5:

∇θJ(πk) =Ey∼πk

### (6)

We observe that this is equivalent in expectation to the gradient of the reverse KL divergence
DKL(πk(·|x)∥π(·|x,c)) in Equation 2. Thus, our method can be viewed as an on-policy RL algorithm that
maximizes rewards inferred by comparing the student’s current behavior to its own “wiser,” demonstration-
aware counterpart.

### 3.2 VALIDATING THE ICL ASSUMPTION

The core hypothesis of SDFT can be seen as the assumption in Equation 4, which states that a model con-
ditioned on an expert demonstration behaves like the (unknown) optimal policy for that task π∗k+1(y|x) ≈
π(y|x,c) and therefore it can be a good teacher. The quality of this approximation depends on 2 conditions:

1. Optimality: The teacher’s expected reward must match that of the unknown optimal policy:

```
Ey∼π(y|x,c)[r(y,x)]≈Ey∼π∗k+1[r(y,x)]
```
```
In other words, samples drawn from the demonstration-conditioned policy should achieve near-maximal
reward on the task.
```
2. Minimal Deviation: Due to the trust-region regularization in Equation 3, the optimal policy πk∗+1(y|x) is
    the one closest to the current model among all the ones that maximize reward. Thus, we require:
       DKL(π(·|x,c)||πk(·|x))≈ DKL

### 

```
π∗k+1(·|x)||πk(·|x)
```
### 

```
That is, among all policies that achieve optimal reward, the teacher should be close, in the KL sense, to
the πk.
```
The second requirement, remaining close to the current policy, is crucial for practical viability. If the
demonstration-conditioned teacher simply mimicked the example verbatim, it would deviate substantially
from the base model, losing the benefits of on-policy learning. What makes the teacher valuable is that it
produces new, task-appropriate behavior while remaining anchored to the base model. Moreover, prior work
shows that distributions close to the pretrained distribution suffer significantly less catastrophic forgetting and
better preserve general capabilities (Shenfeld et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025).

Empirical Validation. While we cannot verify these conditions theoretically, we evaluate each empiri-
cally. We use the Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct model (Hui et al., 2024) as the base policy and the ToolAlpaca
dataset (Tang et al., 2023). In this benchmark, the model receives a tool-API specification and a user re-
quest, and must identify the correct tool call. Without demonstrations, the base model solves only 42% of


examples. When provided with the appropriate demonstration c for each prompt x, the teacher achieves a
100% success rate. To further test reward proximity, we manually inspected 50 teacher reasoning traces.
In all cases, not only were the final tool calls correct, but the intermediate chain-of-thought was valid and
semantically grounded. This suggests that the teacher is reconstructing a correct reasoning process rather
than merely copying the expert output. These observations provide evidence for the first requirement, that
the demonstration-conditioned model behaves as an optimal policy.

To verify the second requirement, we measure the KL divergence to the base policy DKL(π∥π 0 ) as a proxy
for the distance to the policy during training πk. We compare this divergence for both the SFT model trained
on demonstrations and the demonstration-conditioned teacher. As shown in Figure 2 (right panel), the SFT
model deviates substantially from the base model (1.26 nats), whereas the teacher remains significantly closer
(0.68 nats)—nearly half the divergence. This validates that the teacher produces high-quality outputs while
maintaining proximity to the base policy, precisely the balance required by the trust-region formulation.

## 4 EXPERIMENTS

### 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING

We evaluate our method in two settings that reflect common forms of post-training adaptation: Skill Learning
and Knowledge Acquisition. These correspond to improving performance on a new task, and integrating
novel factual information into a pretrained model.

In Skill Learning, we study whether a pretrained LLM with broad capabilities can acquire a new, narrowly
defined skill without degrading its existing abilities. We choose to experiment with tasks the models had not
been explicitly fine-tuned on (unlike Math or Coding) to show the benefits of continual learning. Therefore,
we test our method on three domains:

- Science Q&A: Undergraduate-level scientific reasoning, using the Chemistry L-3 subset of SciKnowEval
    (Feng et al., 2024).
- Tool Use: Mapping a tool-API specification and user request to the correct tool call, using ToolAlpaca
    (Tang et al., 2023).
- Medical: Clinical reasoning questions, with training data from stage 1 of the HuatuoGPT-o1 pipeline and
    evaluation from stage 2 (Chen et al., 2024).

In Knowledge Acquisition, the objective is different: the model must integrate genuinely new factual content
not present in its pretraining data. We construct a corpus of Wikipedia articles describing natural disasters
that occurred in 2025 (after the training knowledge cutoff), totaling approximately 200K tokens. Following
Mecklenburg et al. (2024), we generate question–answer pairs about these articles, yielding an SFT dataset
roughly 5× larger than the source corpus. These questions probe factual content such as “which regions were
affected by the 2025 Myanmar earthquake?”.

This setting tests whether the model can absorb newly injected knowledge rather than merely improving skills
it already has.

Evaluation. For each task, we evaluate along two primary axes:

- In-Distribution Accuracy: Accuracy on held-out test data for the newly introduced task. For Knowledge
    Acquisition, we use two variants: (1) All details correct (Strict Accuracy). (2) The answer contains correct
    information and no incorrect statements (Lenient Accuracy).
- Previous Capabilities: Performance on a suite of established benchmarks that probe general reasoning and
    world knowledge: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), MMLU (Hendrycks
    et al., 2020), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), and HumanEval (Chen et al.,
    2021). We report the average performance across these datasets as a measure of catastrophic forgetting.

For the Knowledge Acquisition setting, we include a third metric:

- Out-of-Distribution Accuracy: “Indirect” questions whose answers depend on the injected knowledge but
    do not directly reference it (e.g., “Which countries required international humanitarian aid in 2025?”).
    This measures whether the new information has been properly integrated into the model’s internal memory
    rather than memorized in a narrow form.

represents a trained model, with the top-right indicating ideal performance (high accuracy on both new and
previous tasks). SDFT consistently achieves superior Pareto efficiency compared to baselines across all three
skill learning tasks.

Baselines. In the Skill Learning setting, we compare our method to standard SFT and to DFT (Wu et al.,
2025b), which uses importance sampling to treat the offline dataset as on-policy samples. We also include
the recently proposed ”Re-invocation” method (Lu & Lab, 2025), which performs additional on-policy dis-
tillation from the base policy on general-purpose prompts after SFT to restore prior capabilities.

In the Knowledge Acquisition setting, we compare our method to CPT (Continual Pre-Training), which trains
directly on the text corpus using next token prediction loss and SFT, which trains on the question-answer
pairs. In addition, we also compare with pure ICL methods. Because the full corpus exceeds the model’s
context window, we evaluate RAG with an oracle retriever that always provides the correct article for each
question.

Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed on the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model. For each base-
line, we perform a hyperparameter sweep and report results for the model achieving the highest validation
performance on the target task. Full datasets, hyperparameters, and training protocols are provided in Ap-
pendix B.

### 4.2 ON-POLICY LEARNING LEADS TO BETTER GENERALIZATION

Prior work has shown that on policy learning achieves better in-distribution performance than SFT (Ross
et al., 2011), as well as superior out-of-distribution generalization (Chu et al., 2025). We investigate whether
these advantages also arise in our on-policy distillation framework. For that, we measure performance on test
set on all our training tasks, as well as OOD generalization in the Knowledge Acquisition setting.

Results. Results for Skill Learning, as shown in Figure 4, indicate that our method achieves higher new-task
accuracy than SFT, which represents better in-distribution generalization. We attribute these gains to the fact
that off-policy learning trains only on expert-induced trajectories; errors at test-time can push the policy into
unseen states, causing compounding errors. On-policy imitation learning avoids this mismatch by training on
the state distribution induced by the learned policy itself (Ross et al., 2011).

The results for Knowledge Acquisition appear in Table 1.

model’s training, it cannot answer any of the questions
correctly. Consistent with earlier observations (Mecklen-
burg et al., 2024), continual pretraining performs poorly.
SFT on questions improves performance substantially
but still lags behind our SDFT. On strict accuracy, it
reaches 80% while our on-policy method achieves 89%
and nearly closes the gap to the oracle RAG model. The
advantage becomes even clearer on out-of-distribution
questions, where our method achieves close to perfect ac-
curacy, while SFT’s performance remains low. This dis-
parity underscores a key limitation of SFT: it teaches the
model to reproduce specific answers but does not reliably

Figure 5: (Left) SDFT benefits from model scale. Performance gap between SDFT and SFT on the Science
Q&A task increases with model size, as larger models have stronger in-context learning capabilities. (Right)
SDFT improves pass@k across various k, indicating genuine skill acquisition rather than entropy collapse.

incorporate the underlying facts into the model’s broader
knowledge base.

Finally, with on-policy RL there is a concern for superficial improvements through entropy reduction rather
than acquisition of new behaviors (Yue et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a). To ensure our gains are not merely
due to distributional sharpening, we evaluate pass@k for k up to 128 in the Skill Learning Setting. As shown
in Figure 5 (right), the performance gains over both the base model and SFT persist uniformly across all k.
This indicates that the improvements reflect genuine skill acquisition rather than entropy collapse.

### 4.3 LEARNING WITHOUT FORGETTING

A central claim of SDFT is that, due to its on-policy nature, it can acquire new skills while mitigating catas-
trophic forgetting. To test this, we perform the following experiments:

1. Single Task Learning. A convenient case study for continual learning is fine-tuning a model on a single
    task. Using the Skill Learning setting, we compare the broad capabilities of our models before and after
    training on each task.
2. Multi-Task Continual Learning. We investigate a more complex continual learning experiment in which
    a single model is trained sequentially on each task. The goal here is to measure catastrophic forgetting over
    longer training and to see whether the model retains the capabilities it learned at each stage of training.

.Results. The results for single-task training, presented in Figure 4, show that our method is the only ap-

proach to improve performance on the new task without significant degradation in prior capabilities. In
contrast, standard SFT produces substantial catastrophic forgetting across all evaluated benchmarks. Aug-
menting SFT with the “re-invoke” procedure partially restores lost abilities but does not recover the base
model’s full capabilities. DFT, which performs approximate on-policy updates, exhibits reduced forgetting
relative to SFT but still results in noticeable degradation. For the breakdown of the score over prior tasks, see
Table 5.

We now turn to the more challenging setting of long-horizon continual learning, where a single model is
trained sequentially on all three skills. Figure 3 shows that SDFT enables stable accumulation of skills
over time. As training progresses, the model improves on each newly introduced task while maintaining
performance on previously learned ones. In contrast, SFT exhibits severe interference—performance on
earlier skills rapidly degrades once training shifts to a new task, resulting in oscillatory behavior rather than
cumulative learning. These results demonstrate that SDFT supports true continual learning, allowing a single
model to incrementally acquire multiple skills without catastrophic forgetting.

### 4.4 EFFECT OF MODEL SIZE

Our method relies fundamentally on the model’s in-context learning ability. The teacher signal comes from
the model conditioned on demonstrations, and the quality of that signal depends on how well the model can
interpret and extrapolate from those examples. This suggests that larger models, whose in-context learning


abilities are known to improve with scale (Brown et al., 2020), should yield stronger teacher policies and
therefore better SDFT updates. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a scaling experiment using several sizes
from the Qwen 2.5 family (Hui et al., 2024), evaluating each on the Science Q&A task.

Figure 5 (left) illustrates a clear trend. At small scales, such as the 3B variant, the model’s in-context learning
is too weak to provide meaningful teacher guidance, and performance lags behind standard SFT. However,
as we increase the size, the gains from our method grow consistently. The 7B model achieves a four-point
improvement over SFT, and the 14B model widens the margin to seven points. This monotonic improvement
suggests that the effectiveness of our algorithm is tightly coupled to the model’s ability to perform in-context
reasoning, and, as larger models continue to exhibit stronger ICL behavior, our approach is likely to become
even more advantageous at larger scales.

### 4.5 TRAINING REASONING MODELS WITHOUT REASONING DATA

A major practical challenge in post-training reasoning models is the construction of high-quality supervision.
Supervised fine-tuning for reasoning models typically requires access to intermediate reasoning traces, which
are expensive to collect from human annotators and often unavailable from closed-source models that expose
only final answers. As a result, many real-world datasets provide only the final answer, without the full chain
of thought.

Naively applying SFT on such data can be harmful for reasoning-capable models. Because SFT directly
matches the target responses, when demonstrations contain only short answers or abbreviated reasoning, this
suppresses the model’s existing long chain-of-thought behavior. For example, consider a model that reliably
produces long chains of thought, but is post-trained using demonstrations that provide only concise solutions.
Direct SFT penalizes long reasoning traces in favor of short outputs that better match the supervision, causing
a collapse in reasoning depth. We hypothesize that our on-policy self-distillation framework avoids this
failure mode. Because the student policy is trained to match the outputs of a demonstration-conditioned
teacher derived from the same model, the supervision preserves the model’s internal reasoning style even
when the external data contains only final answers. In effect, the teacher induces a reasoning-consistent
target distribution, allowing the model to adapt without collapsing its reasoning behavior.

```

Olmo-3-7B-Think 31.2 4612
+ SFT 23.5 3273
+ SDFT (Ours) 43.7 4180
```
```
Table 2: Training reasoning models with answer-only
supervision. SFT degrades both task performance and
general reasoning behavior (indicated by shortened
responses). SDFT avoids this collapse by learning
from a demonstration-conditioned teacher rather di-
rectly from the demonstrations.
```
We evaluate this hypothesis using Olmo-3-7B-
Think (Olmo et al., 2025) and fine-tune it on the
medical task described earlier. Importantly, this
dataset contains no explicit chain-of-thought an-
notations. We compare standard SFT against our
method, measuring both task accuracy and the aver-
age number of generated tokens, which serves as a
proxy for retained reasoning depth.

Results. Table 2 presents the results. Standard
SFT substantially degrades performance, reducing
accuracy from 31.2% to 23.5% and sharply short-
ening responses, indicating a collapse in reasoning
behavior. In contrast, our method significantly improves accuracy, reaching 43.7%. These results demon-
strate that our approach enables effective task adaptation for reasoning models even in the absence of explicit
reasoning data.

### 4.6 WHAT DRIVES THE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE?

Our method combines two ingredients: a demonstration-conditioned teacher policy and an on-policy dis-
tillation objective. In Subsection 3.2, we validated that the conditioned model constitutes a high-quality
teacher—producing correct outputs while remaining close to the base policy. A natural question then arises:
if such a teacher already exists, is on-policy learning necessary, or would standard distillation suffice?

To isolate the source of the performance gains, we compare our full algorithm against two alternative ways of
leveraging the same teacher: (1) SFT from the teacher, where the student is trained offline to imitate samples
generated by the teacher. (2) Offline distillation from the teacher, where the student minimizes a KL loss
on a fixed dataset of teacher-generated outputs (Mitra & Ulukus, 2025). We use the Tool Use task for the
comparison.

cannot be attributed solely to teacher quality.
```
Results. As shown in Figure 6, neither form of of-
fline distillation matches the performance of our on-
policy approach. While distillation from the teacher
improves over standard SFT, it consistently under-
performs our method. This gap indicates that the
benefits of SDFT cannot be attributed solely to the
quality of the teacher and further highlights the im-
portance of on-policy learning.

## 5 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

Relationship to on-policy RL. SDFT is not an
alternative to on-policy RL, but addresses a com-
plementary learning regime. The two methods
operate under different supervision assumptions:
SDFT applies when learning from expert demon-
strations without access to an explicit reward func-
tion, whereas on-policy RL assumes a reward signal
and optimizes expected return through exploration.

Importantly, the two approaches can be naturally combined. As shown in Figure 5, SDFT consistently
improves pass@k across a wide range of k, indicating that it increases the diversity and quality of high-
probability generations. This suggests that SDFT can serve as an effective initialization for subsequent RL
fine-tuning, providing a stronger starting policy.

If one nevertheless compares the training dynamics, a practical advantage of SDFT is its efficiency. Our
method requires only a single on-policy generation per prompt, whereas many on-policy RL methods, such
as GRPO, rely on group-based sampling to estimate relative advantages, substantially increasing generation
cost. Moreover, our supervision is provided at the token level (or even the logit level), providing denser credit
assignment than the trajectory-level advantage used in GRPO.

Computational Costs. A practical consideration when adopting SDFT is that, unlike standard SFT, it re-
quires generating on-policy rollouts during training. In our experiments, this results in approximately 2.5×
the computational cost in FLOPs and roughly 4× the wall-clock training time compared to SFT. However, this
additional cost must be viewed in context: many existing continual learning approaches, such as Re-invoke,
require sequential training stages—first performing SFT, then conducting additional on-policy training to re-
store degraded capabilities. When accounting for this multi-stage process, SDFT can actually reduce total
training time while simultaneously achieving better performance on the new tasks.

Learned Artifacts. A subtle failure mode of our approach is that the student can inherit spurious linguistic
patterns from the teacher. Because the teacher is conditioned on demonstrations or text passages, it may
produce responses prefaced with phrases like ”Based on the text...” or ”Following the example...” The student,
although receiving no such context, sometimes nevertheless reproduces these markers, having learned them
as part of the teacher’s output distribution. Empirically, we find that masking the loss over the first few
tokens during training effectively suppresses these artifacts without harming downstream accuracy. While
this workaround is effective in practice, it is fundamentally a heuristic fix. A more principled solution remains
an open problem.

Requirements for Model Capability. The effectiveness of SDFT depends critically on the base model’s
in-context learning capabilities. As demonstrated in our scaling experiments (Figure 4a), smaller models
with weak ICL abilities fail to provide meaningful teacher signals. Additionally, the fundamental design of
our algorithm imposes constraints on the types of adaptations it can support. SDFT excels at acquiring new
skills or knowledge while preserving existing capabilities, but struggles when the desired behavior requires
a fundamental shift in the model’s generation patterns. For instance, we found that transforming a non-
reasoning model into one that produces explicit chain-of-thought traces proved difficult. Future work should
explore modified objectives or prompting techniques to enable more aggressive behavioral changes when
necessary.


Future Work. Several promising directions remain for extending SDFT. First, our method can be naturally
combined with on-policy RL, either sequentially by using SDFT as an initialization before reward-based
fine-tuning, or simultaneously by blending demonstration-based and reward-based learning signals. Second,
although on-policy learning substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting compared to off-policy methods,
some degradation of prior capabilities remains. Developing complementary techniques that further minimize
forgetting represents an important avenue for future research. Finally, while we focus on expert demonstra-
tions, extending SDFT to learn from non-expert or noisy demonstrations, or from unstructured data such
as user conversations, would broaden its applicability to real-world continual learning settings where high-
quality supervision is scarce.

## A ADDITIONAL ABLATIONS

### A.1 ESTIMATING THE KL GRADIENT

A central component of our objective is the gradient of the KL divergence between the current policy πθ(y|x)
and the teacher policy π(y|x,c). For sequence models, the KL divergence is defined at the sequence level as:

```
KL(πθ||π) =Ey∼πθ
```
### 

```
log
```
```
πθ(y|x)
π(y|x,c)
```
### 

where y = (y 1 ,...,yT) is generated autoregressively. Differentiating this quantity is non-trivial because πθ
appears both in the sampling distribution and inside the logarithm, and different practical estimators trade off
bias, variance, and computational cost (Tang & Munos, 2025).

We consider and ablate several commonly used KL gradient estimators.

Token-level (partial) estimator. A widely used approximation decomposes the KL into token-level terms
and differentiates each independently:

```
btokeng =
```
### XT

```
t=
```
```
log
```
```
πθ(yt|y<t,x)
π(yt|y<t,x,c)
```
```
∇θlogπθ(yt|y<t,x)
```
As shown in recent analyses, this estimator corresponds to a partial derivative of the sequence-level KL: it
ignores the effect of early tokens on future token distributions and is therefore biased with respect to the true
gradient (Tang & Munos, 2025).

Full analytic per-token estimator. An alternative is to compute the KL analytically at each timestep by
marginalizing over the vocabulary:

```
banalyticg =
```
### XT

```
t=
```
### X

```
v∈V
```
```
log
```
```
πθ(v|y<t,x)
π(v|y<t,x,c)
```
```
∇θlogπθ(v|y<t,x)
```
This estimator has strictly lower variance than sample-based token estimators, but it remains biased at the
sequence level, since it still does not account for how the choice of ytinfluences future states y>t. Despite
this bias, it is often computationally attractive because it leverages quantities already produced during the
forward pass.

Rao-Blackwellized estimator. Following recent work (Amini et al., 2025), one can further reduce variance
by Rao-Blackwellizing the KL estimator, analytically integrating over next-token distributions while retaining
Monte-Carlo sampling over prefixes. This yields an unbiased estimator of both the KL and its gradient with
provably lower variance than standard Monte-Carlo estimators. However, this estimator is more expensive
to compute.

Where kθ(y<t) is the stepwise KL term KL(πθ(·|y<t,x)||π(·|y<t,x,x)).

We empirically ablate all three estimators in our training pipeline. Despite its theoretical bias, we find that
the full analytic per-token estimator consistently yields the most stable optimization and best downstream
performance. In contrast, the token-level estimator exhibits higher variance and weaker KL control, while
the Rao–Blackwellized estimator did not provide measurable gains in our setting relative to its additional
complexity.

We also experimented with drawing multiple trajectories per prompt to reduce variance in the gradient estima-
tor, which is theoretically beneficial for Monte-Carlo estimates. In practice, however, increasing the number
of samples per prompt produced negligible improvements while substantially increasing compute. As a re-
sult, we adopt a single-trajectory-per-prompt setup combined with the analytic per-token KL estimator in all
main experiments.


### A.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMONSTRATION-CONDITIONED CONTEXT

We analyze which components of the teacher context are essential for the effectiveness of our method in the
Knowledge Acquisition setting. Recent self-distillation approaches for knowledge injection perform offline
distillation using only the raw corpus as context (Eyuboglu et al., 2025; Kujanpa ̈ ̈a et al., 2025). In contrast,
our approach differs along two dimensions: (i) the teacher is conditioned not only on the source text but also
on a worked answer, and (ii) distillation is performed on-policy.

Figure 7: Conditioning the teacher on both article text and answer (89% strict accuracy) substantially out-
performs text-only conditioning (75%), showing that the full demonstration context is critical for effective
knowledge transfer.
In this subsection, we isolate the effect of the teacher context while holding the on-policy training procedure
fixed. Specifically, we compare three variants: conditioning the teacher on only the article text, only the
answer, and the full text-plus-answer context. A direct comparison to offline distillation methods is deferred
to Section 4.6.
Results. The results are shown in Figure 7. Conditioning the teacher on the full text-plus-answer context
yields the strongest performance, achieving 89% strict accuracy. Using only the article text substantially
underperforms, consistent with prior findings that text-only distillation provides a weak and noisy supervisory
signal. Conditioning on answers alone improves performance over text-only context but still falls short of
the full context. These results suggest that answer-conditioned context plays a critical role by providing a
stronger guidance for the student policy.

### A.3 CHOICE OF TEACHER MODEL

We ablate the choice of teacher policy used for distillation. While our framework does not require an external
teacher, the stability of training depends critically on how the teacher is instantiated.

Using the frozen base model as the teacher yields stable training but consistently underperforms, as the
teacher fails to reflect improvements acquired during learning. At the other extreme, using the student model
itself as the teacher leads to severe instabilities. In this setting, small stochastic fluctuations in token-level
probability updates can be rapidly amplified through the on-policy feedback loop, causing training to diverge.
We find that maintaining an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student parameters provides an ef-
fective compromise. As shown in Figure 8, the EMA teacher tracks the student’s progress while smoothing
high-variance updates, resulting in both stable training and superior final performance.

## B TRAINING AND EVALUATION DETAILS

### B.1 TRAINING DETAILS

All experiments were conducted using the Hugging Face TRL library. Each experiment was conducted on a
single NVIDIA H200 GPU. We perform full fine-tuning of the entire model’s parameters. For each method,
we performed a hyperparameter sweep over learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs. We report test
results for the model checkpoint that achieved the best validation performance on the target task.

Figure 8: EMA teacher provides stable and effective training. Using the frozen base model, which fails
to track learning progress lead to inferior results. Using the current student directly as the teacher leads to
training instabilities.

Tables 3 and 4 present the full hyperparameter search spaces and final selected values for the Skill Learn-
ing and Knowledge Acquisition settings, respectively. Across all tasks, we found that SDFT benefits from
training for multiple epochs—typically 2 epochs for Skill Learning tasks and 4 epochs for Knowledge Ac-
quisition. In contrast, SFT tends to overfit rapidly and showed no performance gains beyond a single epoch
in most cases.

For SDFT, The teacher context was constructed using the prompt template shown in Section 3. We employed
the analytic per-token KL gradient estimator (see Appendix A.1) with a single on-policy rollout per training
example.

### B.2 EVALUATION DETAILS

Sampling Strategy. For accuracy metrics, we used greedy decoding (temperature = 0). For pass@k experi-
ments, we used temperature = 1.0 with nucleus sampling (top-p = 0.95).

Statistical Reporting. Unless mentioned otherwise, all experiments were run over 3 random seeds. We
report mean performance and 95% confidence intervals across seeds.

Prior Capabilities Evaluation. We assessed performance on general capabilities using the suite of bench-
marks described in Section 4.1: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), MMLU
(Hendrycks et al., 2020), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), and HumanEval
(Chen et al., 2021). All benchmark evaluations were conducted using the Language Model Evaluation Har-
ness (Gao et al., 2024).

### B.3 DATASET DETAILS

Science Q&A. We used the Chemistry L-3 subset from SciKnowEval (Feng et al., 2024), splitting the data
into approximately 75% train, 5% validation, and 20% test. To construct expert demonstrations, we queried
GPT-4o, sampling up to 8 responses per prompt and retaining a single response that matched the correct
final answer. This procedure yielded valid demonstrations for 100% of training examples. Since this is a
multiple-choice dataset, accuracy was computed by exact match between the model’s final answer choice and
the ground truth.

Tool Use. We used the ToolAlpaca dataset (Tang et al., 2023), following the original train-test split provided
by the authors. Expert demonstrations were included in the original dataset. Accuracy was evaluated using
regex matching against the ground-truth API call, accounting for variations in argument ordering.

Medical. We built upon the HuatuoGPT-o1 dataset (Chen et al., 2024), which provides both an SFT training
set and a collection of problems with only final answer (used in the original paper for RL training). For train-
ing, we used only the English-language questions, yielding approximately 20,000 examples. For evaluation,
we randomly sampled 1,000 verifiable questions from the verifiable problem set. Since these are open-ended
clinical reasoning questions, we used GPT-5-mini as an automated evaluator with the following prompt:


```
You are an expert medical evaluator assessing whether a model’s
response correctly answers a medical question. Your task is to
compare the model’s response to the reference answer and determine
if the model’s response is:
```
1. CORRECT: The response contains the key medical information from
the reference answer, even if phrased differently or includes
additional correct medical details.
2. INCORRECT: The response is medically wrong, misses the main
point, or provides incorrect medical information.
Focus on medical accuracy and completeness, not on writing style or
verbosity.

```
[Medical Question]
{question}
[Reference Answer]
{reference_answer}
[Model Response]
{model_response}
Evaluate the model’s response. Output ONLY one of: "CORRECT" or
"INCORRECT".
```
Knowledge Acquisition. We constructed a corpus of Wikipedia articles describing natural disasters that
occurred in 2025 (after the model’s knowledge cutoff), including:

2025 Myanmar earthquake, 2025 Kamchatka earthquake, 2025 Uttarakhand flash flood, Typhoon Kalmaegi,
Tropical Storm Wipha, Cyclonic Ditwah, Hurricane Melissa, Kentwood Carson Tornado, July 2025 Central
Texas floods.

Following Mecklenburg et al. (2024), we used GPT-5 to generate question-answer pairs from these articles,
using the following prompt:

```
You are a helpful assistant that helps me write questions for an
exam. You will be given a wiki article and you will need to write
100 question on the content of the wiki article. The question should
require recalling multiple pieces of information from the wiki
article. Do not repeat the same question
```
```
The questions should be in the following format:
Question: <question>
Answer: <answern>
```
We also manually verify that the same question wasn’t generated more than once. For evaluation, we used
GPT-5-mini as an automated evaluator with the following prompt:
